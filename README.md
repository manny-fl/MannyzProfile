<h1 align="left">Hey there!  ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="left" padding-top="20px">About Me</h3>
<p align="left">I am Manny, a website developer currently attending Mt. San Antonio College for Website Development.</p>
<p align="left">I enjoy creating and putting things together. Web development seems to be just that! Recently I began looking for work and 
    couldnt be more exited for what the future holds pursuing a career in website development.
</p>
<p align="left">Aside from website development I also enjoy practicing martial arts and personal training. Believe it or not, these skills are more similar than you'd think. Feel free to ask me how! :)
